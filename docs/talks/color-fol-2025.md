And a very incomplete list of some of my favorite color things:
 - Interaction of Colors by Josef Albers: a little book that goes through how colors look different next to different colors.
 - [Book of Shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com/06/)
 - [coolor](https://coolors.co/f2d7ee-d3bcc0-a5668b-69306d-0e103d)
