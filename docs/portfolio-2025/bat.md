I designed, fabricated, and programmed an ergonomic controller intended to be used to code. Given my occasional wrist pain, and my creative postures while working on planes and busses, I used the fabrication skills I was learning in the How to Make Almost Anything class to create a prototype for the controller I wish I had.

Unlike traditional keyboards and mice, users aren't restricted to using the device against a surface. This could be useful for folks with limited mobility, and in general allows for keeping the wrist at a comfortable angle while using more varied postures using a computer.

## Features

 - Custom molded to fit my hand, by 3d scanning a clay model and recreating in Fusion360.

 - Five joysticks with button presses, which give tactile feedback.

 - Low-cost 3d printed key caps can additionally customize.

 - Modular components, so pieces could be swapped out. E.g. the pinky finger toggle could be swapped for, say, a hypothetical capacitive touch-based one. For example, the prototype had an additional gyroscope to sense the devices orientation.



In addition, I hope to use it for live performances to control my live visuals software.
