I perform live visuals with the livecode.nyc group in NYC. I use an audio-reactive system I created that I can modify live during a performance.

I've been wanting to find ways to connect code with people, and one way I've found this is by live performances. The setting is usually as follows: I am on a stage writing code to control visuals while the person next to me writes code to control audio. I've usually prepared some material that I think would go with the snippets of audio I've heard, but otherwise there is a large degree of improvisation where I try to anticipate where the sound is going and bring larger changes into the code. The audience can see the visuals, the code used to create the visuals and audio, and us on stage performing.

Many of my performances are documented [here](/events/).
