The How to Make Almost Anything class is intensive, often featuring a new mode of computer-controlled manufacturing each week. Having no experience furniture building or with a CNC machine, but always interested in getting in over my head and then trying to reason my way through it, I drew on my interest in crystal structures to create a unique dynamic modular bookshelf.

Each layer has three shelves. A shelf is formed between the bookend and shelf by 90 degree angle for the books to sit against, rotated around 15 degrees so the books are leaning against the bookend. The other side of the shelf supports the neighboring shelf. The layers are stacked on top of each other, also rotated slightly to better support the next layer

The joy of pattern-based approaches is you just need to work through connecting a single component to its neighbors, and suddenly you can extend it as far as you need.

This creates a dynamic, modular shelving system, with two distinct pieces (four if you count the modifications for the bottom and top shelves)

Here is a 3d scan of my fully-loaded bookshelf.
