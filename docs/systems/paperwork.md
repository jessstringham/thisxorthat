Sometimes I use generative art to create SVGs that I can pen plot or vinyl cut or laser cut (when I have access to a laser cutter.)

Here's a collection of some things I've created with my pen plotter and vinyl cutter.

### Ceramic

These cards are based on the system [ceramic](/systems/ceramic/). This is a second variation 
I did in February 2024 for [Plot Party](/events/20120212_dailys_plotparty/).

### Blobs

One of the early applications of the [unit cells](/systems/unitcells/) system was pen plotting! Because I 
couldn't rely on variation over time, I needed a way to make variations over space.

### Subways

Some gel pens dracing out an algorithm loosely
based on Anni Albers' Intersecting woven textile.

### Swirls

A combination of unitcells and a work-in-progress swirls system.

### Globe

One of my first pen plotted pieces from July 2023 based on [substations](/systems/substations/).

### Ash

The [ash](/systems/ash/) was one of the first where I thought I could use the vinyl cutter.
