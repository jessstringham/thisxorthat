Long before I started creative coding, I loved the work coming out of Nervous System, such as these [leaf-inspired lamps](https://n-e-r-v-o-u-s.com/projects/sets/networks/).
I found a link to [Reunion's paper on leaf venetion](http://algorithmicbotany.org/papers/venation.sig2005.pdf)
in Anders Hoff's [series on generative algorithms](https://inconvergent.net/generative/), and decided to give it a go.

**Leave** was my first system I wrote in Rust. The repo I do most of my work in is still called "leave"!

I also tried implementing the closed venetion pattern. It has a few quirks, but I love how it draws circular patterns.

I can create interesting patterns by shifting the colors:
