Importantly, [this week ended with a livecode performance on a 100ft by 30ft (30m by 10m) LED screen](/events/20260125_livecode_shenzhen/)! (At the time of writing, I still need to upload photos and documents.)

I resurrected a few sketches for the show, like Anisotropic (the one that draws shaders), and Leafed (which draws leaf veins). I found a bit of time to play all of them, along with my classic Kaleido system.

## PureData

It turned out I had the wonderful [Char Stiles](https://charstiles.com) DJ for my performance, so I could thoroughly enjoy just doing viz on a huge screen instead of worrying about my PureData sounds. But I still played with PureData, building envelope generators. Envelopes on the volume and pitch are key in making pure sine and saw waves sound more like instruments. At this point, I've started to get a little more wary of PureData: I still don't quite understand why, sometimes, when I open up files, my constants disappear. I'm beginning to miss Rust and regular code again, and even dare to entertain how hard it would be to build sound synthesis from scratch in Rust...
