## TouchOSC

So last week's blog finished with talk about SuperCollider, and early this week I finally tried out TouchOSC, and it was really nice to quickly throw together an interface. Since I'm thinking a lot about how parameters map to things, I'm wondering if OSC might be a nice common interface between the UI for parameters, and the thing that uses the parameters.

I've been hearing about TouchOSC, and Kodelife, and such, and I'm happy that I'm finally trying them out.


## WebGPU

I started looking at [using JavaScript for WebGPU](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/your-first-webgpu-app) by running through part of this tutorial. It's incredibly similar to Rust's wgpu, so I'm already familiar with a lot of options! Besides that being convenient for me, it means that if I do get around to finishing up a wgpu reference, it might be useful for more folks than just those that are using Rust.

I'm not sure if I'll start writing all of my graphics code in JavaScript instead of Rust, but it's nice to try out.

## Livecode.nyc June show

I played [a show](/events/20250623_livecodenyc/) with livecode.nyc this weekend! I used the same system from ErrorCamp, which has fewer guardrails than other systems, but it managed to work the whole time and I really like how it looked.

One thing is that I don't think is quite there yet are the geometry (straight lines and cubic beziers seem pretty typical!), but I'm incorporating the shaders into a lot of my other things and I'm hopeful I'll find the magical combination I love!
