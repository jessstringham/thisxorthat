Randomness is important in both creative coding and machine learning.
I particularly enjoy how noisy pixels look, so I created a zine to 
explain the technical details of how those noisy textures work, 
some tricks I learned, and a bunch of noisy graphics I made.

You can download the current version **[here](/assets/docs/thisxorthat-noisypixels.pdf)**.
For best results, print as a booklet!
