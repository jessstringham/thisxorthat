This summer I open-sourced the framework I use for nearly all of my generative art. I also shared a web-based demo of a simple sketch based on that framework.

The [framework's codebase is here](https://github.com/jessstringham/murrelet). 
I generally try to share my code as open-source, so I'm happy that 
I've finally gotten the code in a state I can open source it. I'm looking forward to being able to share 
full code examples of some sketches. 

I also have a [demo running on the web here](https://www.thisxorthat.art/live/foolish-guillemot/), where I use Rust compiled to WASM. This is a personal breakthrough because
it means I can still write in Rust, but be able to share
outputs on the web and use web browser features.

The projects were also fun on the tech side. I entirely decoupled the framework from Nannou (which I've learned a lot from but at this point, I was mostly using it for rendering and animation management.)

I still have many possibilities for the future here: I'm looking forward to sharing more interactive demos, and I'm starting to see what a more stable API for 
the framework could look like. I'm excited about reaching this milestone where I can share a lot more!
