First show of the new year was a livecode.nyc show to coincide with the [TOPLAP 20th anniversary](https://blog.toplap.org/). I did viz using a system that creates a textured version of [unitcells](/systems/unitcell/) (actually the same one I used at [electric abyss](/events/20231208_electric_abyss/)).
