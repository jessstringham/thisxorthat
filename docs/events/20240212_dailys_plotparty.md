Following a short break after [Genuary 2024](/events/20240101_genuary/), I wanted to participate in [Plot Party](https://penplotterartwork.com/plotparty/).



I had previously tried plotting for last year's [7 weeks of making](20230705_dailys_7weeks.md), but only completed 4 weeks. I do get out my plotter periodically when something seems like it'd work well as a plot. Plot Party is only 6 days, which is a more manageable commitment for my kitchen table.

I had a lot of fun with this! The other nice thing about 6 days is that I kind of did want to show off. With the evolution of my software, I created this one I'd been thinking of for a very long time.
