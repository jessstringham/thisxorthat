Someday I'm hoping to share more code that I write, though it's been refreshing not to need to polish the code to the standards I would hold myself to for public code.

In the meantime, I've been hoping to share some of the ideas I'm using to build the software.

I was accepted into the Algorithmic Pattern Salon, so there's one such write-up [here](https://alpaca.pubpub.org/pub/dpdnf8lw/release/1?readingCollection=1def0192), and a recording of a short presentation [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk-nElNKkJI&list&t=6579s).
