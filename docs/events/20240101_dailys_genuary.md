I participated in [Genuary](https://genuary.art), a prompt-base daily challenge.
For the 31 days of January, I posted something that related to the prompt.

It was my second year participating. It was fun to see how far my software had come: during the first three weeks I was traveling around Japan and was pleased that I could usually still create things I liked in the short amount of time I had.

Currently you can find my genuary posts on my [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/_thisxorthat/) and [mastodon](https://tech.lgbt/@this_xor_that/media).
