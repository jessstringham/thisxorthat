At the end of [ITP Camp 2023](https://itp.nyu.edu/camp2023/), we put on the ITP Camp Performance Showcase. I got to create a system to perform visuals to accompany [phantomchip's](http://phantomchips.com) noisy performance with tactile wearable synthesizers. 

I tried to match the aesthetics of the instruments. I've been enjoying early computer graphics, so I used simple polygons but added feedback to make colors change in unexpected ways. It was also a happy surprise that the edge artifacts helped make the colors shimmer.

The livestream of the performance is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/live/70rhl_gDIM8?si=d53T7k7ourGCaHqC&t=1893).
