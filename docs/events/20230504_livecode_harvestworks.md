I made a few contributions to Regen Circuit, a month-long residency of [livecode.nyc](https://livecode.nyc) at [Harvestworks](https://www.harvestworks.org/may-5-audiovisual-performances-by-katarina-hoeger-thisxorthat-and-mylar-caitlin-cawley-and-melody-loveless/) on Governors Island.

### Video

I recorded a performance using the [Oscilloscope](/systems/oscilloscope) system and used [Tidal Cycles](http://tidalcycles.org) to create audio. You can watch the video and see a longer description [here](https://youtu.be/2Mjp14VCK2o).

### Performance

I performed visuals for a live performance with a longtime friend [Katarina Hoeger](http://katarinahoeger.com). This was my first live performance using shaders, and I tested the limits with a mixture of audio reactive 3D sdfs, [dithering](/systems/dithering), as well as some computationally heavy [L-systems](/systems/ash).
