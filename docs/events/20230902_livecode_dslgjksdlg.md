I performed at the [livecode.nyc](livecode.nyc) show at Wonderville. I got to perform with Hardcore Software on audio.

For this performance, I drew inspiration from the shapes formed on [Chladni Plates](https://americanhistory.si.edu/science/v/video_chladni_intro.htm), a very cool physical visualization of vibrations. 

I combined this with feedback, the new [unitcell](systems/unitcell.md) feature I've added to my [livecode](systems/livecode.md) stack, and a colormap-builder technique first used in the [ITP Camp showcase](src/20230627_livecode_itpcampshowcase.md).
