For the third year, I participated in [Genuary](https://genuary.art), a prompt-base daily challenge.
For the 31 days of January, I posted something that related to the prompt.

This might have been my most challenging year, and to be honest I ran a little bit into February.

Currently you can find my genuary posts on my [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/_thisxorthat/).
