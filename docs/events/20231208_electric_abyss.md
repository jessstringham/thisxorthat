I performed visuals for a full three acts of modular synth show.

I created a new audio-reactive system for each act and modified them live.

The first act was based around [fractal noise](https://thebookofshaders.com/13/) I had options to threshold
the noise and then use that as part of a feedback loop that was distorted by noise.

The second act was a variation of [unitcells](/systems/unitcell/) using textures. This one's really fun to play with: the 
repeating patterns mean that almost any variation looks interesting.

The last act was for a heavier show, so I stuck with a dithered monochromatic grid of unitcells that I could modify live,
like with domain warping or different patterns.

Overall, it was an ambitious night for me to create and perform three new visuals. 
I think it went quite well, with a few learnings 
(e.g. Ideally make sure to set up in a place I can see the visuals without straining even when the room gets packed.
Smoke machines can mess with projections.)
