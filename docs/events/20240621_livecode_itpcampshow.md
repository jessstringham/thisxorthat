I performed with the very talented [Alice](http://instagram.com/flightedcormorant) at the ITP Camp Performance Show case.

Alice's hummed through a contact mic while audience participants drew a "score" on her forearms. I incorporated Alice's heartbeat into my livecoded piece: her bpm measured by a heart rate monitor would set the bpm of the visuals.

The visuals were based on an idea of a musical score: the program displayed the last few seconds of audio and applied signal analysis to control what visuals appeared. Rather than flowing linearly, the score followed a twisted path and repeated on top of itself from different angles.
