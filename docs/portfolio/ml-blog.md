After a few years in the tech industry, I went back to school to get a Master's in Artificial Intelligence. One advantage of studying after a few years in the industry was that I was already quite good at programming. I played on my strengths to help me learn something new, and learned by teaching through blog posts.

In some posts, I would explain a foundational topic that I was having trouble wrapping my head around, like KL-divergence or Gibbs sampling.
I would try to come up with ways to create toy problems, for example, by matching my textbook examples, and then try to walk through the examples in a new way. This challenge of creating the data (which wasn't explained anywhere) and trying to teach the topic was very useful.

In other posts, I implemented projects that were why I had decided to study machine learning in the first place. For example, I used Bayesian statistics to calculate which coffeeshops I thought were better on different dimensions ("coffee", "laptop", "reading") and created an adaptive data collection method that would quiz you with straightforward questions ("which is better for laptops: Carnigorm or Soderberg?")

As another example, I was wondering how those bands around bird legs would help scientists count how many seagulls were in Stockholm, so I read, implemented, and created an animation of the statistics behind Capture-Recapture Methods. I also implemented an animation using d3.js which you can see [here](https://jessicastringham.net/2019/08/18/mark-recapture/).

All of these were side projects for my grad school.
I continued posting a few times after starting my job, though nowadays I more often post on `thisxorthat.art`. I still refer to the posts semi-frequently and I still get many site visits.
