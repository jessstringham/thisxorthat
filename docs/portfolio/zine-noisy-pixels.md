"Noisy Pixels" is a zine I created about the aesthetics and technical aspects of using noise to modify pixels in images. I was inspired by looking closely at the dithering in riso-printed work. I knew my background in machine learning would help me to make unique connections.

My rule of thumb is that as soon as you realize something is starting to come naturally, it's a good time to create a guide for the version of yourself back when you weren't sure where to begin. Other writeups about randomness I found hadn't connected noisy pixel textures to technical implementation in the way I envisioned.

Because I was attracted to the noisy pixels in printed media, I wanted to create something physical. A zine gave me a linear 2D format to lay out the story. 

The zine is in three parts. It begins with operations you can do once you have noisy pixels because I want to start by enticing the readers with what is possible. Next, I explain different types of noise, including random and blue noise. It finishes with a more technical section on parallel vs sequentially generating pseudo-random numbers. Throughout the zine are examples of noisy pixel art I've created as well as custom titles (to touch into typography) to continue to give inspiration for the reader to use noisy pixels.

I used grid systems to create the layout in InDesign, a software I had used ages ago for my high school newspaper. I created many examples in matplotlib and numpy, and some additional ones using an interactive program I created.

I've distributed to the zine to creative code clubs and technical groups, and also have it freely available online. I feel that it is good for folks with some creative coding experience but want to push into more advanced topics, or for folks with technical experience who want to see how they can connect it to to aesthetics.
