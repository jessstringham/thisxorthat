"Tiny Language Models" was a class I developed to show how to make a program to learn from its environment. With Large Language Models abuzz, and given my master's thesis was in natural language processing and machine translation, I decided to center the class on using conditional probabilities to build a tiny language model.

I premiered the class at ITP Camp in 2023, where participants like myself were invited to share their knowledge about technology and art. About a dozen people attended the workshop in person and it was available as a recording after.

I started the class with an activity based on the game Exquisite Corpse: I instructed the class to pass around a long thin strip of paper and write down one word (I hoped the physicality of the long strips of paper would make class stragglers curious). The catch was that the paper was folded so each person would only see the previous two words. This demonstrated the Markov property, a concept often tied to conditional probabilities for sequential models. We then read the sentences aloud, briefly commented on whether they made sense, and then I launched a class discussion encouraging reflection on how they came up with that next word, and how that related to language models.

I spent the rest of the class walking through a code demo on how conditional probabilities, which is just a matter of going through the text and counting and dividing, can create a surprisingly good (though tiny) language model.

I think the concepts of conditional probabilities and making simple programs that learn from their environment is a powerful idea for creating interactive pieces, and I'd like to continue to teach this in different ways. Framing it in terms of a language model felt timely for 2023, and I enjoyed being able to touch on more complex topics for an enthusiastic audience.
